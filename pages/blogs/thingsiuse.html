                As a Computer Science student, I often need to both write code and take notes. I am always on the hunt for the next best piece of software. In my journey I've come across a ton of different software for both notetaking, and coding. First, I'd like to take a look the coding software I've used.<br>

                    Vim is great, and I love the Vim motions. I still use Vim for smaller edits on my system, but for writing code it isn't my favorite. My main problems with Vim are:<br><br>

                <li>LSP integration can be a pain</li>
                <li>The customizablity is great, but can often lead to always wanting to find the "perfect" setup.</li>
                <li>Multiplexing is not an enjoyable experience without external programs.</li>

                <br>

                LSP Integration on Vim can be an extremely annoying process with a mess of different plugins, and language servers. While not an overly complicated or difficult process it can be extremely time consuming to edit your config to make it work. In relation to your config file comes the configuration itself. While having a lot of customizability is always a plus it leads to a lot of time spent trying to make your "perfect" setup. This doesn't really affect everyone, but it definitely is hard for me to tell myself to just stop when it comes to my Vim config. Finally, multiplexing on Vim isn't as enjoyable as it is elsewhere. Vim does have it's own built in multiplexing capablities, but I've always felt that it was clunky and suboptimal. TMUX is good in conjuction with Vim, but requires it's own setup.
